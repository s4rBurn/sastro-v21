Thanks to [Pranav/obnoxiousnerd](https://github.com/obnoxiousnerd), Astro [v0.22.15](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md#02215) now supports adding a `draft: true` field to the front matter of a Markdown blog post to prevent the page being build during `astro build`! ðŸ¥³

With any luck, you wont see this page... until I remove the draft flag!

## Here's the front matter for this page... 

```astro

## And here's a React Counter component...

Just so we have something else exciting in front matter to show off.  ;)

<ReactCounter client:load/>
